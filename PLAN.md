# Plan

## Goals

### skeleton

- Goal: a Python author defines two node types, edits a graph of them in the
    browser, saves and loads it, and Python sees the result, all from one
    command.
- Kind: new behaviour.
- Success measure (each is a test):
    1. `@node` on a typed function and a pydantic `Node` subclass each appear
        as a node type in the browser palette.
    2. In the browser, two nodes can be added and linked; a link between
        incompatible port types (float to str) is refused by the Rust engine.
    3. After editing, `app.graph` in Python holds the same nodes and links,
        and `app.run()` returns the computed value.
    4. `uv run examples/a_basics/a2_two_nodes.py` starts a local server, opens the
        page, and stops cleanly on Ctrl+C.
    5. A function returning a pydantic model (e.g. `-> DivMod` with fields `q`
        and `r`) shows one output port per field; a link from either port
        works and `app.run()` passes the right value on.
    6. `app.save("g.json")` writes nodes, links and positions with a format
        version field, and `app.load("g.json")` restores the same graph in
        Python and in the browser.
- Status: approved 2026-10-19; all six criteria are met, pending the user's
    own try-out. Criteria 1, 2, 3 and 5 by tasks 1 to 4 (tests, and by hand in
    the browser). Criterion 6 by task 6 (round-trip tests; the open page getting
    the loaded graph is a websocket test, not yet looked at by eye). Criterion 4
    by task 10 (a real process: the page URL is opened, Ctrl+C ends it with exit
    0; the browser opener was stubbed in my check, so the user's own browser
    opening is not yet seen).
- Added: 2026-10-19

### antimony-theme

- Goal: the editor looks and feels like Antimony (Matt Keeter's CAD tool) by
    default, with themes switchable and the credit in the README. Depends on
    `skeleton` (needs a canvas to draw on).
- Kind: new behaviour.
- Success measure (each is a test, except 1, which you judge):
    1. Side by side with the reference screenshots (kept outside the repo),
        you accept the default dark theme: charcoal node cards with a grey
        header bar (id left, type name right, menu icon), right-aligned
        labels with dark value boxes, a greyed placeholder on a linked input,
        type-coloured port squares (orange numbers, olive green for others),
        smooth S-curve wires, a dark dot-grid canvas, a light outline on the
        selected node.
    2. All colours, sizes and fonts come from one `Theme` definition in
        `element-51-core`; no colour literal appears in the drawing code.
    3. Two themes ship: `antimony` (dark, default) and `antimony-light`
        (light grey canvas). `bay.serve(theme="antimony-light")` shows the
        light one; an unknown name raises an error naming the valid ones.
    4. Right-click opens a nested category menu in the Antimony style; typing
        filters across all categories. `@node(category="Math")` and the
        pydantic class form both set the category.
    5. `README.md` credits Antimony and Matt Keeter with a link, and says the
        look is inspired by it. No Antimony image or code is in the repo.
- Status: approved 2026-10-19. Spec approved 2026-10-19 (DESIGN.md, under
    "antimony-theme spec"), with these choices: rows stacked like Antimony, the
    header icon opens a small menu (task 18), the theme is chosen only by
    `serve(theme=...)`. In progress: tasks 11 to 15 and 18 are done (the user accepted the look, so
    criteria 1 to 5 are met); the goal waits only for the user's look at task 18.
- Added: 2026-10-19

## Current state

Phase: executing the task list. Done: walking skeleton, rename to `element-51`,
tasks 1 to 15 and 18 to 22 plus 6a (push), 16 (rename) and 17 (rounded look); the skeleton
goal is complete and the antimony-theme goal has criteria 1 to 5 met (the graph
runs, saves, undoes and has the Antimony look, a light theme, a nested menu and
the README credit).
Next step: the known problems the user approved on 2026-10-20 (the add-node
menu that does not scroll, the dark flash on the light theme, `App` thread
safety), then drafts of the README body and docs prose for the user's review.
Waiting on the user: their own try-out of goal
`skeleton` and a look at the menus (examples `d4_menu` and `d5_card_menu`); they
have looked at `a2_two_nodes` and said it looks good.
Nothing is uncommitted in this repo (checked 2026-10-20 after task 22). All
merged branches are deleted. In `~/Functions`, the profile settings were committed
and its leftover branch deleted at the user's say-so. There is no remote, so nothing
is pushed. The user approves each task start and each branch deletion in one
reply ("Yes, start task N, and delete the merged branch ...").

## Baseline

Measured 2026-10-20 after task 22, Apple silicon, Python 3.13:

- ruff format, ruff check, mypy, ty: pass.
- pytest: 217 passed, 100% coverage, about 4 s (includes every example).
- cargo fmt, clippy (`-D warnings`), test: pass, 115 tests.
- `tools/build_wasm.py`: builds, about 7 s from cold.
- By hand in the browser pane: the two-output example shows `3 q` and `2 r` on
    the node's rows; the class-form example runs and its menu lists the class
    names; a long text value is trimmed with an ellipsis to fit its row; a node
    added in the browser is still there after a reload, with the run values
    cleared; with `c2_live_push.py` an open page shows each node the script
    adds, with no reload, and Run then gives 2.0 to 6.0; with `d1_big_graph.py`
    a node drags and its move survives a reload, the wheel zooms and empty
    canvas pans, Delete removes the selected node (its links go) or the selected
    wire, and Run then shows `has no value` downstream; with `d2_values.py` typed
    numbers change the Run result, `abc` in a number box is refused with a message
    and the box restored, the boxes follow pan, zoom and drag, and the values and
    a ticked box survive a reload; with `d3_undo_redo.py` Ctrl+Z undid a drag and
    a node delete (the node came back with its links) and Ctrl+Shift+Z redid a
    move, and the result survived a reload; with `e1_light_theme.py` the canvas is
    light grey with a dot grid, the cards stay dark and a selected wire is dark;
    with `d4_menu.py` the right-click menu has Math > Trig > sine flyouts, the
    search box lists matches with their paths, Enter adds the first and Escape
    closes, and the flyouts flip left near the right edge; with `d5_card_menu.py`
    the icon opens a Delete node popup, the click removes the node and its links,
    Cmd+Z restores them, and Escape or a click elsewhere closes it.

## Tasks

Tasks 1 to 15 approved 2026-10-19; tasks 1 to 15 are done (removed from the
list below, their detail is in DESIGN.md and git). A task added later needs its
own approval in words. Sizes are estimates by analogy with the skeleton (about
80 lines of Python, 60 of Rust); there is no measured data yet. Every area below is new code, so no existing test pins it; each task
writes its tests first. `element-51-web` is checked by hand in the in-app
browser, and its logic goes into `element-51-core` where `cargo test` covers it.

### Goal `skeleton`, Tier 1: walking skeleton

Done: tasks 1 and 2 (node types reach the browser; edits synced with ack and
rollback).

### Goal `skeleton`, Tier 2 (ordered by value over risk plus cost)

Done: tasks 3 (run the graph), 4 (several outputs, class-form nodes), 5
(reload keeps the graph; no product code was needed) and 6a (Python pushes to
open browsers; added 2026-10-19 at the user's choice, detail in DESIGN.md), 6
(save and load as versioned JSON), 7 (pan, zoom, move, select, delete), 8
(value editing with HTML inputs), 9 (undo and redo), 10
(`a2_two_nodes.py`, `serve(open_browser=True)`, clean Ctrl+C). Extra task 17,
added at the user's request and approved in words 2026-10-19: rounded node cards
and wire ends (done; the radius is `card_radius` in the Theme's metrics). Rounded
port markers were tried at the user's request and reverted because they did not
like them. At the user's request the wires were also thickened and then copied
from the Antimony screenshots (colour by source port, thickness, curve), and the
wire curve was changed to stop it hugging a card's edge; details in DESIGN.md.

### Goal `antimony-theme`: done

Tasks 11 (`Theme`), 12 (the Antimony look; the user accepted it), 13
(`antimony-light`, `serve(theme=...)`) and 14 (categories and the nested menu
with search) are done, and 15 (README credit); detail in DESIGN.md. Task 18 (the card menu) is also done.


### Extra task, added by the user 2026-10-20

23. **CI for the Rust crates and the WASM build** (approved by the user
    2026-10-20). Done: `.github/workflows/rust.yml`. Detail in DESIGN.md.
22. **Page theme keys** (approved by the user 2026-10-20 in housekeeping). Done:
    the `page` section, six colours, docs. Detail in DESIGN.md.
21. **FastAPI and NiceGUI examples** (asked by the user 2026-10-20, with the
    page fix and the `examples` group approved in words). Done: `f1_fastapi_host`, `f2_nicegui_host`,
    the websocket address from the page's path. Detail in DESIGN.md.
20. **Port styles** (from the user's sketch, with their answers). Done: the
    `ports` theme section by type and side, with colour and shape. Detail in
    DESIGN.md.
19. **Theme files** (the user chose the option and asked for the docs). Done:
    `serve(theme="my_theme.json")`, `docs/themes.md`, example `e2_theme_file`. Detail in
    DESIGN.md.

### Tier 3: listed, not executed

- A release guard that fails `uv build` itself when `web/` is missing: CI now
    checks that the wheel built after `build_wasm.py` holds the WASM, but a local
    `uv build` without the build is still not stopped.
- Automated browser tests for `element-51-web`: large setup, and the logic is
    already in `element-51-core`.
- `wasm-opt` size pass on the 706 KB WASM: no size budget was set.
- Binary channel for large data: a non-goal for now.
- Export the graph as Python code: not in the goals.
- Docs prose and README body: not unasked.

## Open questions

Oldest first.

1. (2026-10-20) Does text now look sharp on the user's screen, and is zoom fast
    enough? Three fixes were made on their report (device-pixel canvas, opaque
    context, Verdana and Monaco; wheel and pinch rates) and I could only check
    them in the built-in browser. The user has not said.
2. (2026-10-20) `~/Functions/_rsync/vscode/settings.json`, the template that
    `rsync-sync` copies into new projects, is modified in the working tree and not
    committed: most hidden-file excludes flipped to `false` and `.github` hidden. It
    looks like the explorer-exclude extension saving its toggle state, so I left it.
    Commit it or restore it? Also three untracked `.bak` files there.

## Known problems

- `README.md`, `docs/index.md` and the `pyproject.toml` description are still
    template text. Only its Credits section is written.
- Without a build, `asgi_app()` fails at start (the `web/` folder is missing);
    the tests avoid this with a fake folder. `.github/workflows/rust.yml` has not
    run on GitHub yet, since there is no remote; its commands were run by hand.
- `element-51-web` has no automated test; it is checked by hand in the browser.
- `App` is not thread-safe. A script that edits while the server runs should do
    so from one thread. A browser edit and a script edit that propose the same
    node id race; Python refuses the later one and the browser may show the
    reason, or may not, if the snapshot that makes the edit moot arrives first.
- An empty input box means "use the default", so a text input cannot be set to
    the empty string. There is no script call for setting a value (`app.apply`
    with `SetValue` works but does not push to open pages).
- A long output value is trimmed with an ellipsis on the node. The full value is
    only available from `app.run()`; there is no hover or tooltip yet.
- A node that returns NaN or infinity as a float is sent as JSON `null` (pydantic's
    default), so the browser would show `null` for it. Checked 2026-10-19 with
    `NodeOutcome(node="n1", status="ok", outputs={"out": float("nan")})`. Not handled.
- The WASM build works around a broken `rust-lld` in the rustup toolchain
    (see CLAUDE.md, things that bite). Not reported upstream.
- `uv build` bundles `src/element_51/web/` only if `tools/build_wasm.py` ran
    first (checked 2026-10-19: the wheel held the WASM). Nothing stops a build
    without it, which would ship a package whose `asgi_app()` fails.
- The add-node menu's tree does not scroll (a scrolling panel would clip the
    flyout submenus), so a menu with more top-level entries than fit in the window
    runs off its bottom. Search results do scroll.
- The page starts in the dark theme and switches when the first snapshot names
    another one, so a light-theme page can flash dark for a moment.
- A bool input is the browser's own checkbox. A theme can tint it when ticked
    (`accent`), but the unticked box stays white.
- Greyed hints in value boxes use Antimony's sampled `#505050` on `#303030`,
    which is faint. The user may want it lighter (a theme colour, `placeholder`).
- Text sharpness on the user's screen is unconfirmed (see Open questions); a
    further step would be a larger card font or integer-pixel text positions.
- `a1_hello_world.py` is the project template, not an example of the library: it
    imports numpy and creates `__data__`, and the example tests skip it by name.
- The NiceGUI host example (`f2_nicegui_host.py`) has no automated test, because
    `ui.run_with` changes NiceGUI's global state; the FastAPI one is tested.
- The page keeps a few fixed sizes (1 px borders, the banner and search-box
    paddings, the Run triangle, letter spacing); see DESIGN.md, task 22.
- The undo history is per page: a reload empties it, and edits made by other
    pages or scripts are not in it (see DESIGN.md, undo and redo).
